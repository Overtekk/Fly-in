## 📂 Description

### 📜 Summary:

This project implements an efficient autonomous drone routing system. The objective is to navigate a fleet of drones from a central starting hub to a target end hub through a network of connected zones, completing the mission in the fewest possible simulation turns.

The pathfinding algorithm must dynamically handle several strict network constraints:
* **Zone Types & Movement Costs:** Zones can be `normal` (1 turn), `restricted` (2 turns), `priority` (1 turn), or `blocked` (inaccessible).
* **Occupancy Limits:** Both zones (`max_drones`) and connections (`max_link_capacity`) have maximum simultaneous drone capacities.
* **Collision Avoidance:** Drones move simultaneously but cannot enter a zone if it exceeds its capacity or conflicts with another drone's path.

**Technical Constraints:**
* The codebase must be 100% Object-Oriented (OOP).
* No external graph management libraries (like `networkx`) are allowed.
* The code must be strictly typed and pass `mypy` and `flake8` validations.
* The simulation includes a step-by-step visual representation (terminal colors or graphical interface) and a strictly formatted text output for each turn.

### 📝 Rules:

- Must be written in **Python >=3.10**.
- Must adhere to the **flake8** and **mypy** standard.
- Crash and leaks must be properly managed. All errors must be handled gracefully.
- Code must include type hints and docstrings *[(following PEP 257)](https://peps.python.org/pep-0257/)*
- Any library that helps for graph logic is forbidden (such as networkx, graphlib, etc.).
- Project must be completely **object-oriented**.

### 📮 Makefile:

This project must have a Makefile and the following rules:
- **install**: install project dependencies using **pip**, **uv** etc...
- **run**: execute the main script of the project.
- **debug**: run the main script in debug mode using Python's pdb.
- **clean**: Remove temporary files or caches.
- **lint**: execute the commands `flake8` . and `mypy . --warn-return-any
--warn-unused-ignores --ignore-missing-imports --disallow-untyped-defs
--check-untyped-defs`.
- **lint**: execute the commands `flake8 .` and `mypy . --strict`.

## ⚙️ The Algorithm:

To navigate the drones efficiently, this project implements a **Reverse Dijkstra Algorithm**.

Standard pathfinding algorithms typically calculate the shortest route from point A to point B. However managing 1000 independent drones would require recalculating paths constantly, which is highly inefficient.
And I wanted to try to optimize this project.

So, instead, the algorithm starts from the End Hub and propagates outward to every other connected zone, calculating the lowest cumulative cost to reach the destination.

The cost to traverse a connection is not uniform. It accounts for the specific constraints of the zones (e.g., Normal, Priority, Restricted, or Blocked). A Blocked zone represents an impassable wall (ignored from the explorable graph), while a Restricted zone might impose movement delays.

This reverse calculation creates a comprehensive **"cost map"** *(or heatmap)*. Once generated, any drone, regardless of its current location, simply queries its neighbors and moves to the node with the lowest remaining cost to the exit. It transforms complex individual pathfinding into a simple, global flow.

While the algorithm dictates the ideal path, the Manager dictates the reality of the simulation. It acts as the central state machine and orchestrator.

Its primary responsibilities include:

- **Process the turn:** The Manager processes the environment turn by turn. It decides which drone is allowed to move and which must wait.

- **Constraint Enforcement:** It strictly applies the network's physical rules. If a zone has a max_drones capacity of 20, the Manager acts as a gatekeeper, blocking the 21st drone and forcing it to wait or reroute, overriding the algorithm's optimal path to prevent collisions.

- **Multi-Turn Resolution:** It handles complex transit states, such as drones taking multiple turns to cross Restricted zones, keeping track of their exact status between two discrete locations.

- **Data Synchronization:** It feeds the sanitized, turn-resolved data to the visual Renderer, ensuring the graphical interface (Arcade) strictly reflects the underlying logical truth.

---

## 🔋 Software Architecture (OOP)

The project follows a strict **Object-Oriented** hierarchy to ensure modularity and type safety:

- Parsing (`src/maps_parser/parser.py`): Parsing logic. Validate only a map, or the whole folders and give instructions if a map isn't valid.

- Simulation Manager (`src/simulation/manager.py`): Core of the program. Create all drones and zones. Call the algorithm. It orchestrates the clock, moves the drones each turns, and ensures that no rules are broken, that drones can move, where to go.

- Drone Agent (`src/object/drones.py`): Represents an individual unit. It tracks its own state (moving, waiting, finished, current location).

- Network Components:

    - Zones (`src/object/zone.py`): Nodes in our graph. They hold metadata like max_drones, zone type, drones on it and weight.

    - Connections: Edges between zones. They manage max_link_capacity.

- Renderer (`src/graphics/renderer.py`): Decoupled from the logic, it only consumes the state provided by the Manager to update the UI each turn.


#### The Parsing

The parser act as a gatekeeper. You can provides a specific map as an argument. In this case, only this map will be checked. In the other hand, if no arguments are provided, the all `maps` folder will be scanned. Each folder will be a category, and files will be checked. All of this gave a menu with maps selection and even a category to see which maps can't be use and why (to fix them!).

### Menu: choose your map, see errors

</p>

#### The Simulation Engine (Manager)

While the algorithm dictates the ideal path, the Manager enforces the reality:

- **Collision Avoidance**: If a zone reaches its `max_drones` capacity, the Manager acts as a gatekeeper. Drones are forced to wait or take a detour, even if their algorithm wants them to move forward.

- **Multi-Turn Resolution**: In a restricted zone, a drone is "busy" for 2 turns. The Manager handles this intermediate state, ensuring the drone is neither at the start nor the end of its move during the transition.

## 🖥️ Visual representation

The visual representation use the `Arcade` library. A powerfull library used to makes visual and games, providing a high-performance OpenGL-accelerated view of the simulation.

Once you launch the script, a window will appear with custom sprites.\
Use **SPACE** to start the simulation.

A window in the top left can be used to control the simulation:
- You can pause anytime you want (the use of the **SPACE** key also works)
- You can control the speed (the use of the **+** and **-** keys also works). Minimum is 100% (default), and maximum is 1000% speed
- You can close the program by using **ESCAPE** key or the cross of each windows
- You can move the window anywhere on the screen
- A progress bar will show the completion of the simulation (a drone that have finished will make the bar progress)
- Visual legend to know which icon is what.

<br>

The rendering is performed in **real-time**.
Why ? For two reasons:
- When I was building the algorithm and the manager, it was more easy for me to see whats goes wrong, what works.
- I feel like it's better to see in real-time what going on even if it's a bit more chaotic to code (like the progress bar is updated when a drone goes to the end_hub and not when its on it.)

<br>

Funny things can be done by clicking somewhere on the window. Find them!

### ✨ Optimization

I tried my best to optimize this program. The sprites are loaded once (also ensuring that the path exist), all the visual is well optimize (and I'm sure that it can be better).

For the algorithm, I tried to have something that launch once and then, drones and/or the manager will do the rest **(O(V²))**. In this case, everything works clean and it's not too heavy for the computer.

The code is a bit messy. I'm still learning and I need to works on other projects. I can rewrite everything in a better way but it not be efficient and other projects will be more readable. Sorry for that.
